# Solitaire
 
Made by myself from scratch for a project in grade 12. 
Can be played by multiple people (though I suppose it wouldn't be called Solitaire at that point).
To play, run the .exe file named "Solitaire" in (bin -> debug).

This was made when I was first learning OOP and programming in general. I would go through it and make it better, but I want to keep the original version here for personal reasons.

I am not exactly sure about reqs needed in order to run this, so I would just hope that it works on the system being used.
